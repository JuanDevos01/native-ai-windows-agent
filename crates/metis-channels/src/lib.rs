//! Metis Channels — chat channel integrations.
//!
//! This crate provides:
//! - **base**: The `Channel` trait that all channel implementations must satisfy
//! - **manager**: `ChannelManager` — lifecycle orchestration and outbound message routing
//!
//! Individual channel implementations (Telegram, Discord, etc.) will be added
//! as feature-gated modules.
